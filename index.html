        <div id="Explanation">The collatz conjecture is an unsolved mathemetical problem, hence it being a conjecture
            and not a theorum. It was named after Lothar Collatz, who personally worked on it. He is claimed to be the
            creator, although he denies being the first to work on it.(study.com)

            A whole, positive integer, X, is given. If it is odd, apply 3x + 1 and if it is even, apply x/2. This
            process is meant to be applied continuously. However, given time, the initial number so far always
            repeats in a cycles of 1, 2, 4, and back to 1[study]. The inssue of the conjecture is whether or not this
            applies to all numbers, or just the ones that have been applied so far. Perhaps you will
            be able to find an exception!
